    "In order to use descriptive statistics to analyze the csv file, I called upon some simple functions in python. I first used the describe() function, which demonstrates the difference in mean time for congruent and incongruent word lists in the stroop test. This shows that the mean time for incongruent word lists was about 8 seconds longer. This difference remains consistent when looking at the min and interquartile ranges for each. The main deviation is that the maximum time for incongruent grows to nearly 13 seconds longer than its counterpart. \n",
    "I then called upon the median() function which offered a similar result of seven seconds difference. These metrics to this point were depicting a certain statistical significance between the time it took to correctly analyze the incongruent word list and the congruent. \n",
    "I then called the var() function to check the spread of the data. Given that the variance is a high number, we can conclude that the data has a large spread, and is not clustered around the mean. \n",
    "The skew() function helps us determine whether the data is normally distributed (how close the skew result is to zero). The congruent data shows a more normal distribution, and the incongruent data shows a greater skew to the left of the mean.\n",
    "I followed that with the corr() function to analyze the correlation between the two variables. The results show a positive correlation of .35. This means for every increase of 1 in the time it took for the participant to read the congruent word list, there would be an increase of .35 in the time for the incongruent test. \n",
    "Finally, I used the cov() function to look at the level the two variables varied together. This shows similar results to our corr() function and confirms previous findings. "
